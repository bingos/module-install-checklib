NAME
    Module::Install::CheckLib - A Module::Install extension to check that a
    library is available

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL

      use inc::Module::Install;
      checklibs lib => 'jpeg', header => 'jpeglib.h';

    The Makefile.PL will exit unless library or header is found.

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::CheckLib is a Module::Install extension that integrates
    Devel::CheckLib so that CPAN authors may stipulate which particular C
    library and its headers they want available and to exit the
    "Makefile.PL" gracefully if they aren't.

    The author specifies which C libraries, etc, they want available.
    Devel::CheckLib is copied to the "inc/" directory along with the
    Module::Install files.

    On the module user side, the bundled "inc/" Devel::CheckLib determines
    whether the current environment is supported or not and will exit
    accordingly.

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "checklibs"
        Requires a list of parameters. These are passed directly to
        Devel::CheckLib "check_lib_or_exit" function. Please consult the
        documentation for Devel::CheckLib for more details on what these
        parameters are.

        This is generally the function one should use in Makefile.PL, as it
        exits gracefully and plays nice with CPAN Testers.

    "assertlibs"
        The same as "checklibs" but uses Devel::CheckLib "assert_lib"
        instead. "assert_lib" dies instead of exiting gracefully. It is
        provided for completeness, please use "checklibs".
