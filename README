NAME
    Module::Install::CheckLib - A Module::Install extension to check that a
    library is available

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL

      use inc::Module::Install;
      checklibs lib => 'jpeg', header => 'jpeglib.h';

    The Makefile.PL will exit unless library or header is found.

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::CheckLib is a Module::Install extension that integrates
    Devel::CheckLib so that CPAN authors may stipulate which particular C
    library and its headers they want available and to exit the
    "Makefile.PL" gracefully if they aren't.

    The author specifies which C libraries, etc, they want available.
    Devel::CheckLib is copied to the "inc/" directory along with the
    Module::Install files.

    On the module user side, the bundled "inc/" Devel::CheckLib determines
    whether the current environment is supported or not and will exit
    accordingly.

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "checklibs"
        Requires a list of parameters. These are passed directly to
        Devel::CheckLib "check_lib_or_exit" function. Please consult the
        documentation for Devel::CheckLib for more details on what these
        parameters are.
